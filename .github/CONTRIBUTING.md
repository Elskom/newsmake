# Contributing

- Any changes can be pull requested. However we recommend to open issues as well for non-trivial changes.
- Your coding and issue/pull requests will be monitored so we can know if you are perfect to become an core developer which comes with direct access to this repository.
- If deemed as a part of the team, all forks you got can be deleted, but most changes should not be made to master (master is protected so your pushes and even force pushes will be denied). Push them to an temporary branch first and then merge them. Becoming an core developer does not come with any difference. The only difference is that you are not working with forks which helps with not forgetting what an certain fork is for.
